## How can I contribute?

Please use the issue and pull request templates as much as possible. We are using a [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) work style, so we encourage you to use it as well.


### Reporting bugs

Did you find a bug? Please submit an issue. Even if you have unearthed the bug in an 'offline' discussion, please take the time to formally submit this issue, as they are an integral part of the backlog of this project. 

### Suggesting features

Would you like a new feature in the code? New features are also tracked as GitHub issues. Please note that our @GQCG/developers are also researchers with their own set of interests and can postpone development of external features if they would like to.

### Suggesting maintenance

Did you find a code smell? Submit an issue. We work hard on making our API and code as clean and natural as it can be, but no code is perfect! By letting us know of a better solution to a problem, we can continuously improve our code.
