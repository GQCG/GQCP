# GQCP Style Guide

In order to make our source code as uniform as possible, please follow these style guides. We've already [set up the C++ guidelines for VS Code](developer_getting_started/#setting-up-auto-formatting-for-c-source-files), to automate the process as much as possible. For a broad introduction on designing APIs, we think [Swift's API design guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) are a very interesting read.
