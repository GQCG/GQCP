On December 3rd, I will be giving a 30-minute talk at the online [Research Software Developers Day (RSDD) 2020](https://www.be-rse.org/rsdd2020). I'll be presenting our group's vision on reproducible research and I'll cover why the development of GQCP is necessary for the quantum chemical community.
