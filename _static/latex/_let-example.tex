\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em p} & the 0-\/based spinor index, counted in this O\+NV from right to left\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
the phase factor (+1 or -\/1) that arises by applying an annihilation or creation operator on spinor p
\end{DoxyReturn}
\textquotesingle{}s say that there are m electrons in the orbitals up to p (not included). If m is even, the phase factor is (+1) and if m is odd, the phase factor is (-\/1), since electrons are fermions.
