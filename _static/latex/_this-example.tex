Calculate the overlap \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}on$\vert$of\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\+: the projection of between this spin-\/resolved ONV (\textquotesingle{}of\textquotesingle{}) and another spin-\/resolved ONV (\textquotesingle{}on\textquotesingle{}), expressed in different R/\+U-\/spinor bases. The \textquotesingle{}on\textquotesingle{}-\/ONV is supposed to be expressed in restricted spin-\/orbitals, and the \textquotesingle{}of\textquotesingle{}-\/ONV is supposed to be expressed in unrestricted spin-\/orbitals.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em onv\+\_\+on} & The spin-\/resolved ONV that should be projected on. \\
\hline
{\em C\+\_\+unrestricted} & The transformation between the unrestricted spin-\/orbitals and the atomic spin-\/orbitals. \\
\hline
{\em C\+\_\+restricted} & The transformation between the restricted spin-\/orbitals and the atomic spin-\/orbitals. \\
\hline
{\em S} & The overlap matrix of the underlying AOs.\\

\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
The overlap element \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}on$\vert$of\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}.

method can be used to project UHF-\/\+ONVs onto RHF-\/\+ONVs, by calling uhf\+\_\+onv.\+calculate\+Projection(rhf\+\_\+onv, C\+\_\+unrestricted, C\+\_\+restricted, S).
